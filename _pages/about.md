Salute and welcome!

I am an **Assistant Professor** in the [School of Integrated Sciences](https://www.jmu.edu/cise/sis/index.shtml), [James Madison University](https://www.jmu.edu/index.shtml), Virginia, under the Geography program. My research interests lie primarily in **machine learning** and **big spatiotemporal data analytics**.

I am particularly passionate about quantifying and understanding the level of **uncertainty from multi-source data**, e.g., remote sensing, model simulations, and ground observations, and from hybrid dynamical-machine-learning models. My goal is to investigate how to build *accurate*, *reliable*, *trustworthy*, and *realistic* models with machine learning for *Environmental and Earth Sciences*. My work has been applied to **renewable energy forecasting**, **extreme event forecasting**, and **water resource management**.

Have a look around and find out more about me. Don't forget to check out my blog, [the Wanderer's Retreat](/blog/). Feel free to respond and leave a comment. Peace!
