If you are on a slow Internet connection, e.g., the compute node has a limited bandwidth, it is probably better to download the data for [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) ahead of time, rather than having the module to download it at hoc using the slow Internet connection.

These discussions can be helpful for setting this up:
