This is a curated list of guidelines for scholarly posters.

- Leave enough white space.

- Paragraph and figure captions should be at least in a 24-point font (0.9 cm height) and headers at least in a 36-point font (1.2 cm height).
- A serif font (e.g., Times) is often easier for reading main text, and a non-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica) is more legible for headers and figure labels.
- **AGU Specific**: Maximum poster dimensions are 1.8 meters wide by 1.2 meters high (6′ W x 4′ H). Allow for a 1-inch border.
