If you are debating among the three grand options of base graphics, lattice grid graphics, and `ggplot` graphs, you are not alone. I believe the following articles can give you more ideas and probably help you make a decision.

- [How to Create A Lattice Plot in R](https://www.dummies.com/programming/r/how-to-create-a-lattice-plot-in-r/)
- [What's the difference between ggplot and basic plot in R?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51013568)
- [Why I don't use ggplot2 --- Jeff Leek](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/)
- [Tufte in R](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/)
- [Why I use ggplot2 --- David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/r/why-I-use-ggplot2/)
- [Don't teach built-in plotting to beginners (teach ggplot2)](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/)

The following resources can help you get started with `ggplot` in a very efficient way.

- The chapter [data visualization](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) talks about the basic ideas and grammars used in not only `ggplot`, but also in graphs in general;
- The chapter [graphics for communication](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) talks about tunning to make better graphs and publication. Some proposals about how to format your graphs appears very provocative.
- [This tutorial](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html) covers some practical tunning exercises that might not be included in the previous tutorials.
- [Be Awesome in ggplot2](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/be-awesome-in-ggplot2-a-practical-guide-to-be-highly-effective-r-software-and-data-visualization#at_pco=smlwn-1.0&at_si=5d3f2127c41acabd&at_ab=per-2&at_pos=0&at_tot=1) talks about many examples of using the package with codes. I noticed that many articles directly or indicrectly relate to this article.

To dive deeper into the library and the concept of the graph grammar, please refer to the following list.

- Hadley Wickham's book [ggplot2 --- Elegant Graphics for Data Analytics](https://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/331924275X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=ggplot2-20&linkId=4b4de5146fdafd09b8035e8aa656f300) is a great book to read. The author of the book is also credited as the author of `ggplot`.
- The paper [A Layered Grammer of Graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf) introduces the concept of graphic grammars implemented in `ggplot`. This paper will help us producers to understand how to conceptualize graphs and express them.
- [Tufte in R](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/) provides some quick solutions of science-y looking graphs in *base graph functions*, *lattice functions*, and *ggplot functions* with the original purpose to reproduce visualizations from the book [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/1930824130) by Edward Tufte.

Last but not the least, I must not include the `ggplot` [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) for R and the [documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.2.0).

Please let me know if you have found other resources in this regard. Thank you.
